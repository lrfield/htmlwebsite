Hypnotoad is a recurring gag in *Futurama* satirizing the acceleration of anti-intellectual television shows. The thought is that TV producers are getting increasingly better at substituting quality with cheap tricks for inducing emotional stimuli. Therefore, 1000 years in the future, programming would logically distill down to a hypnotizing blend of shapes and colors with no function other than manipulating the viewers brain into a relaxed stupor.  
I believe that Hypnotoad is a good reference point for ranking the content that we consume and produce on the internet. In fact, I will be using "Hypnotoad" as a shorthand descriptor for content that establishes as short of a connection between visual processing and viewer stimulation. To get a better handle on this, let me introduce the extremely nuanced and sophisticated 4-axis Hypnotoad content alignment chart:

Lets populate it with some examples:

You'll notice that with all of our real world examples, we've only been able to populate an L shape around the chart. There is a commonly held misconception that just because media is challenging, it has a positive intellectual effect. I would argue this is incorrect. However, the inverse is largely accurate.
